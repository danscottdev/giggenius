# Candidate Name: Dan Scott

## Professional Summary

I'm a professional web developer with over 5 years of experience, specializing in fully-custom WordPress development. This includes building out custom themes from scratch, implementing bespoke functionality via custom plugins, and other back-end customizations and integrations. In my time as a developer I've worked on a wide range of wordpress sites, ranging from small mom-and-pop business landing pages all the way up to enterprise-grade systems.

I'm especially well-versed in customizing and extending GravityForms, and have built out numerous custom plugins that help businesses integrate GravityForms with their existing business logic and systems. I also have extensive experience in getting WordPress sites to properly integrate on the back-end with other third-party business platforms, such as Salesforce.
